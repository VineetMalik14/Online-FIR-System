# Online_FIR_System

### This is Online FIR System with the following specifications:
1. There are three types of users: citizen, ASI (Assistant Sub Inspector) and SI (Sub
Inspector). Citizen can register their complaint, download FIR and track the
investigation; ASI receives the complaint and approves it; SI accepts a FIR and submits
primary report.
2. The citizen enters the following details for the FIR: Name, Age, Address, Date and time of Incident, Complaint
3. The system will auto generate a number for the FIR. A Complaint will be a predefined
list from which a citizen can select. (eg. Attempt to murder, theft, domestic violence, etc)
and the system will automatically map the complaint to a section (eg. 344, 304, etc.) and
category (murder, theft & robbery, domestic affairs, etc.) [eg. The complaint „domestic
violence‟ will be categorized as „domestic affairs‟]
4. Under each category of crime, there is one or more SI. Any complaint of a crime category
will be allotted automatically to an SI of that category only.
5. The citizen can also track the status of the FIR process. The status of the FIR process is updated by the SI.
